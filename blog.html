      <p>
        In four years' time I hope to become a software engineer in the
        healthcare field because biology is a passion of mine. My plan B is game
        development since I also consider myself to be a creative person and
        have experience with a lot of different creative media. No matter my
        final choice of profession I will try my best to take my teamworking and
        problem-solving skills to the next level as well as gain experience.
